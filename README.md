# L&I Plan Review Flags For Eclipse
This process supports and updates the ArcGIS Feature Service: [Plan Review Flags Eclipse](http://phl.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7a474e2bb78b4f258751e22161e4cc75)

## Feature Layers included with Service
### Inspection Districts
These are GIS polygons representing the outlines of the inspection districts for L&I Operations and Construction Services (as of Summer 2019)

### Corner Properties
Produced from a one-time GIS analysis of PWD Parcels and their proximity to street centerlines.  There is no plan to automate this process, but parcels incorrectly labeled as 'corner properties' can be manually removed by L&I BIDV/GIS upon request.
